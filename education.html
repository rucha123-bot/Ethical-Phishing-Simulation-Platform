            <li><strong>Look for Urgency:</strong> Attackers create a sense of urgency to make you act without thinking.</li>
            <li><strong>Hover, Don't Click:</strong> Hover over links to see the actual URL they lead to.</li>
            <li><strong>Spelling & Grammar:</strong> Professional companies usually don't have major errors.</li>
            <li><strong>Generic Greetings:</strong> "Dear Customer" instead of your name can be a red flag.</li>
